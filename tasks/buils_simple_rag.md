## Build RAG in a notebook

1. Create a database of 100 articles about RAGs.
2. Post identificators of the articles, for others to use the same setup. We will not use DVC for now.
3. Create a retrieval step: answer to user query is searched in the local vector database
4. Use the retrieved documents to enhance a prompt to LLM.
3. Using locally deployed models, test the setup.


### Future work

Evaluation of RAG.
