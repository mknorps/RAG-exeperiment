      "The accurate characterisation of energy exchanges between nanoscale quantum systems and their environments is of paramount importance for quantum technologies, and central to quantum thermodynamics. Here, we show that, in order to accurately approximate steady-state heat currents via perturbative master equations, the coupling-induced reorganisation correction to the system's energy must be carefully taken into account. Not doing so, may yield sizeable errors, especially at low, or even moderate temperatures. In particular, we show how a `reorganised master equation' can produce very accurate estimates for the heat currents when the reorganisation energy is weak and one works with environments with a broad spectrum. Notably, such master equation outperforms its `non-reorganised' counterpart in the calculation of heat currents, at modelling dynamics, and at correctly capturing equilibration. This is so even if both types of equation are derived to the same order of perturbation theory. Most importantly, working with reorganised master equations does not involve additional complications when compared with alternative approaches. Also, invoking the secular approximation to secure thermodynamic consistency does not compromise their precision.\n",

      "The non-equilibrium steady state of a weakly dissipative open quantum system can be studied through master equations [1]. One may think, for concreteness, of a system coupled to various heat baths at different temperatures EQUATION_0. In particular, master equations allow for the characterisation of the stationary heat currents EQUATION_1 flowing from each bath into the system. Provided that these abide by a relationship of the form [2]\n",
      "EQUATION_2\n",
      "which is analogous to the Clausius inequality, one may regard such non-equilibrium open system as a continuous thermodynamic cycle [5, 6]. By tuning system's parameters so as to change the direction and magnitude of the steady-state heat currents, one can switch between cooling and heat-engine operation modes, or seek to optimise energy performance according to some relevant figure of merit [7-12]. One can even ask whether nanoscale thermodynamic devices are distinctively `quantum' in any measurable way, and whether their `quantumness' may be exploited in practice [13-16]. Theoretical progress on quantum thermodynamics has also motivated much experimental work, and this type of energy-conversion cycles have now been implemented on various platforms [17], ranging from trapped ions [18-20] to cold atomic gases [21, 22], quantum dots [23], or colour centres in diamond [15].\n",
      "\n",
      "It thus seems clear that the characterisation of the stationary heat currents flowing through open systems is of paramount importance. However, this strongly depends on the master equation used to characterise them, which introduces some ambiguity. Indeed, working with master equations which are perturbative in the system–bath coupling, affords flexibility in their derivation [24-26]. Specifically, one has freedom to set the reference basis in which dissipative processes occur, by perturbing the microscopic Hamiltonian of the system [26]. Here, we show how choosing the basis of the system Hamiltonian renormalised by the various system–bath couplings, can yield substantially better master equations. Namely, we illustrate how the exact stationary heat currents, the dynamics, and the steady state may all be approximated much more closely than with alternative master equations, even when these are derived to the same order in perturbation theory.\n",

      "This paper is structured as follows: In Sec. 1 we address the issue of the definition of stationary heat currents within quantum thermodynamics. Next, in Sec. 2 we introduce the `reorganised master equation' framework and discuss the influence of the choice of reference basis for dissipative (jump) processes on the definition of stationary currents. In Sec. 3 we illustrate our discussion with two simple examples: the quantum damped harmonic oscillator and the spin–boson model. Finally, in Sec. 4 we summarise and conclude.\n",

      "We have studied the fitness of the reorganised master equation for estimating the stationary heat currents flowing through non-equilibrium open systems. In deriving this equation, the freedom in setting the reference basis for dissipative processes is exploited, so as to ensure correct equilibration in the classical limit. This is achieved by working in the basis of the microscopic system Hamiltonian renormalised by the system–baths couplings. As we have shown, considering two paradigmatic examples, this results in much more accurate estimates of the heat currents, especially at low temperatures.\n",
      "\n",
      "As shown by some of us in Ref. [26], reorganised equations are justified when the reorganisation energies EQUATION_173 characterising the system–bath interactions are small. As shown in the spin–boson example, increasing the values of EQUATION_174 does indeed to errors in the estimation of heat currents. However, the time evolution of the state seems to be more robust, remaining accurate up to much larger reorganisation energies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Importantly, reorganised master equations can be brought into the canonical GKLS from without significant loss in precision, neither in the dynamical description nor in the resulting steady-state heat currents. The same is not true, however, for their `non-reorganised' counterparts–-these predict substantially wrong dynamics, as illustrated in both of our examples. The GKLS form is particularly important for quantum thermodynamics, as completely positive generators guarantee thermodynamic consistency.\n",
      "\n",
      "The manipulations leading to the reorganised master equation may be exploited to derive a whole family of equations. These would all be accurate to the same order in perturbation theory, but can be engineered to have different desirable properties. For instance, one could think of matching the resulting steady state with the true mean-force Gibbs state, rather than with its classical counterpart. This certainly deserves further investigation. Another open question is to clarify the precise relationship between coupling strength ζ, dissipation parameter EQUATION_175, environmental cutoff frequency EQUATION_176, and reorganisation energy EQUATION_177, as all of these quantities seem to play a key role in the derivation of perturbative Born–Markov master equations.\n",

      "The accurate characterisation of energy exchanges between nanoscale quantum systems and their environments is of paramount importance for quantum technologies, and central to quantum thermodynamics. Here, we show that, in order to accurately approximate steady-state heat currents via perturbative master equations, the coupling-induced reorganisation correction to the system's energy must be carefully taken into account. Not doing so, may yield sizeable errors, especially at low, or even moderate temperatures. In particular, we show how a `reorganised master equation' can produce very accurate estimates for the heat currents when the reorganisation energy is weak and one works with environments with a broad spectrum. Notably, such master equation outperforms its `non-reorganised' counterpart in the calculation of heat currents, at modelling dynamics, and at correctly capturing equilibration. This is so even if both types of equation are derived to the same order of perturbation theory. Most importantly, working with reorganised master equations does not involve additional complications when compared with alternative approaches. Also, invoking the secular approximation to secure thermodynamic consistency does not compromise their precision.\n",

      "The non-equilibrium steady state of a weakly dissipative open quantum system can be studied through master equations [1]. One may think, for concreteness, of a system coupled to various heat baths\\footnote{In general, it could also be subjected to external driving [2-4].} at different temperatures Tᵢ. In particular, master equations allow for the characterisation of the stationary heat currents \\dot{\\pazocal{Q}}ᵢ flowing from each bath into the system. Provided that these abide by a relationship of the form [2]\n",

      "\n",
      "which is analogous to the Clausius inequality, one may regard such non-equilibrium open system as a continuous thermodynamic cycle [5, 6]. By tuning system's parameters so as to change the direction and magnitude of the steady-state heat currents, one can switch between cooling and heat-engine operation modes, or seek to optimise energy performance according to some relevant figure of merit [7-12]. One can even ask whether nanoscale thermodynamic devices are distinctively `quantum' in any measurable way, and whether their `quantumness' may be exploited in practice [13-16]. Theoretical progress on quantum thermodynamics has also motivated much experimental work, and this type of energy-conversion cycles have now been implemented on various platforms [17], ranging from trapped ions [18-20] to cold atomic gases [21, 22], quantum dots [23], or colour centres in diamond [15].\n",
      "\n",
      "It thus seems clear that the characterisation of the stationary heat currents flowing through open systems is of paramount importance. However, this strongly depends on the master equation used to characterise them, which introduces some ambiguity. Indeed, working with master equations which are perturbative in the system–bath coupling, affords flexibility in their derivation [24-26]. Specifically, one has freedom to set the reference basis in which dissipative processes occur, by perturbing the microscopic Hamiltonian of the system [26]. Here, we show how choosing the basis of the system Hamiltonian renormalised by the various system–bath couplings, can yield substantially better master equations. Namely, we illustrate how the exact stationary heat currents, the dynamics, and the steady state may all be approximated much more closely than with alternative master equations, even when these are derived to the same order in perturbation theory.\n",
      "\n",
      "This paper is structured as follows: In Sec. 1 we address the issue of the definition of stationary heat currents within quantum thermodynamics. Next, in Sec. 2 we introduce the `reorganised master equation' framework and discuss the influence of the choice of reference basis for dissipative (jump) processes on the definition of stationary currents. In Sec. 3 we illustrate our discussion with two simple examples: the quantum damped harmonic oscillator and the spin–boson model. Finally, in Sec. 4 we summarise and conclude.\n",

[26], the reorganised framework is accurate in describing the system dynamics, regardless of whether the dissipators are in GKLS form or whether they keep the so-called non-secular terms.

Importantly, however, Redfield equations do not enjoy the complete positivity of GKLS generators and a relationship of the form (60) is not guaranteed. They can, however, be used to define heat currents in the form (70), provided that the corresponding Lamb-shift correction is absorbed into the dissipators. Provided that the system–bath coupling remains weak, such Redfield currents seem to behave in a thermodynamically consistent manner [44]. Indeed, we also computed the Redfield heat currents for both of our examples and verified that they coincide with the GKLS reorganised currents.\n",

      "To solve for the dynamics and heat currents, we use the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion approach (HEOM) [51, 52]. In particular, resort to the QuTiP-BoFiN implementation [53], which is integrated in the QuTiP platform [54, 55]. The numerics require the truncation of two expansions. The first one is the Matsubara expansion of the bath correlation function in an exponential series, where Nₖ terms are retained. The second one, is the level of the hierarchy for the so-called auxiliary density operators, N_C. We have checked our results for convergence in both Nₖ and N_C. In our calculations, we have used the Tanimura terminator [53] to speed up convergence. The average heat currents in the non-equilibrium steady state can be calculated according to Eq. (71) by using the auxiliary density matrices [52].\n",

As already advanced, unlike in the linear case, the quantitative agreement between the exact and the reorganised approach breaks down unless the Qᵢ are sufficiently small; this is indeed the regime in which the reorganised master equation (62) is expected to work [26]. Interestingly, however, even if the heat currents break down, Eq. (62) allows one to push the Qᵢ to slightly larger values and still retain good agreement for system operators (populations and coherences are shown). In contrast, Eq.

      "Conclusions\n",
      "\n",
      "We have studied the fitness of the reorganised master equation for estimating the stationary heat currents flowing through non-equilibrium open systems. In deriving this equation, the freedom in setting the reference basis for dissipative processes is exploited, so as to ensure correct equilibration in the classical limit. This is achieved by working in the basis of the microscopic system Hamiltonian renormalised by the system–baths couplings. As we have shown, considering two paradigmatic examples, this results in much more accurate estimates of the heat currents, especially at low temperatures.\n",
      "\n",
      "As shown by some of us in Ref. [26], reorganised equations are justified when the reorganisation energies Qᵢ characterising the system–bath interactions are small. As shown in the spin–boson example, increasing the values of Qᵢ does indeed to errors in the estimation of heat currents. However, the time evolution of the state seems to be more robust, remaining accurate up to much larger reorganisation energies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Importantly, reorganised master equations can be brought into the canonical GKLS from without significant loss in precision, neither in the dynamical description nor in the resulting steady-state heat currents. The same is not true, however, for their `non-reorganised' counterparts–-these predict substantially wrong dynamics, as illustrated in both of our examples. The GKLS form is particularly important for quantum thermodynamics, as completely positive generators guarantee thermodynamic consistency.\n",
      "\n",
      "The manipulations leading to the reorganised master equation may be exploited to derive a whole family of equations. These would all be accurate to the same order in perturbation theory, but can be engineered to have different desirable properties. For instance, one could think of matching the resulting steady state with the true mean-force Gibbs state, rather than with its classical counterpart. This certainly deserves further investigation. Another open question is to clarify the precise relationship between coupling strength ζ, dissipation parameter λ, environmental cutoff frequency Λ, and reorganisation energy Q, as all of these quantities seem to play a key role in the derivation of perturbative Born–Markov master equations.\n",
